# Network-Intrusion-Detection
In a simulated military network environment, it is crucial to protect the system from potential intrusions. Developed a machine learning model that accurately classifies network connections and detects intrusions, ensuring minimal false positives. The solution should be implemented and its performance evaluated.


# Objectives

Preprocess the "Network Intrusion Detection" dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies.

Implement machine learning models for classification.

Train and optimize models to improve detection accuracy.

# Features

Data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering.

Machine learning for accurate threat detection.

Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores.
